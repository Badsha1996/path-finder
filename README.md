## What is this project 
In this section i want to explain the purpose of the project and why i created it
Gooogle maps is an amazing thing that utilize excelent algorithms such as *Dijkstra* and *A-star* So i wanted to see them in action, In order to do that i have created this grid which will simulate and visualize the algorithms

## Algorithms
* Dijkstra - This will gurentee a shortest path
* A-start - This is the fastest algorihtm 
* DFS - It will search each nodes depth till it find that node but it is very slow as it use recursion 
* BFS - It is a great alternative to DFS which find the path using a QUEUE data structure
