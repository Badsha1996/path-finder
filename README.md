## What is this project 
In this section I want to explain the purpose of the project and why I created it
Google Maps is an amazing thing that utilizes excellent algorithms such as *Dijkstra* and *A-star* So I wanted to see them in action, To do that I have created this grid which will simulate and visualize the algorithms

## Algorithms
* Dijkstra - This will guarantee a shortest path
* A-start - This is the fastest algorithm 
* DFS - It will search each node depth till it finds that node but it is very slow as it uses recursion 
* BFS - It is a great alternative to DFS which finds the path using a QUEUE data structure
